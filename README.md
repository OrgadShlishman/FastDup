One of the most important things specifically in neural network and generally in data science, is having a good and reliable dataset. Without that, it's almost impossible to get good results regardless to the target.
*FastDup* is a powerful tool which allows analysis, improvement and better understanding a given dataset. 

In the sequel, we will see some of the features one can use when working with FastDup.
We will provide some examples when running this tool on the RAVIR eye retina dataset.

# Few words about RAVIR dataset
RAVIR is a unique dataset of the retina, which supposed to help for multiple health issues diagnosis, such as diabease, cancer and many more.
The retina, is the only place in the body which allows examining the veins and arteries directly without any invasive action.  
Veins and arteries, can help with early diagnosis which can be very important is some cases (such as cancer). 
The main purpose of RAVIR dataset, is performing classification between veins and arteries, which can lead to better diagnosis. The classification is done as semantic segmentation.

Semantic segmentation of the retina, between veins and arteries is a challenging task, so the better the images' quality, the results of the task should be better.
Using FastDup, we can easily examine our dataset and get important information about it. 
FastDup data analysis, can include: 
  ● Identifying duplicates and near-duplicates.
  ● Detecting anomalies and outliers.
  ● Clustering similar images or videos.


For Example, we can get information (and visualization) about images that exist in our dataset.
